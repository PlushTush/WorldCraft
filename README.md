# World Craft - create your own metaverse world 

### Project goal: 
The goal of the project is to create an entertainment dApp with gamification aspects on the BTTC ecosystem.

### Project Description

World Craft is an ambitious project aimed at creating an entertainment decentralized application (dApp) on BTTC. This innovative platform combines elements of a metaverse with gamification aspects, allowing users to unleash their creativity by building and exploring virtual worlds. 

- **Purchase worlds:** Users have the option to purchase worlds within the platform. Additionally, upon acquiring a world, users will receive two free block colors for customization.
- **Purchase block colors:** Users can expand their creative possibilities by purchasing additional block colors. These colors can be used to add aesthetic variety to the user's creations.
- **Building mode:** After purchasing a world, users can enter Building mode. Here, they have the ability to construct their own virtual world, placing and arranging blocks as they envision.
- **Save world state:** Users can save the state of their created world, ensuring that their progress is preserved for future interactions and exploration.
- **Explore other worlds:** Users can explore the virtual creations of other platform users. This opens up a world of possibilities for adventure and discovery within the metaverse.
